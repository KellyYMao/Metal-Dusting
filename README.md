# Metal-Dusting
Metal Dusting is the corrosion of metallic materials into dust (fine metal particles) in a carbon-saturated atmosphere due to rapid carburization.

This is a prominent issue in syngas, hydrogen, and ammonia production.  
Oil cracking are facilities susceptible to metal dusting.

Fe, Co, Ni base alloys are affected. 
Specific metal dusting mechanisms differ depending on the type of alloy and phase.
Analysis must be done to find the best mitigation procedures.

# Metal Dusting Mitigation Techniques

Coatings:  
Thermal spray coatings can be a physical barrier to carbon but can be less effective depending in porosity.  
Aluminizing is the usage of an aluminum surface treatment to improve thermal corrosion resistance and can be effective around 1095C.  
Oxide scales slow carbon diffusion and prevents carbon accumulation.
Surface finish may prevent the initiation of metal dusting but results are still inconclusive. 

Alloy Element Addition:  
Chrome helps form oxide scale but can have negative effects in low allow steel, may encourage the formation of nucleation sites in cementite layer.  
Alloys with carbide-forming elements (Ti, Nb, Mo) initially degrade less but after corrosion starts metal wastage is severe.  
Columbium could reduce the rate of carburization in parent material. 
Silicon can make alloys more metal dusting resistant.  
Nickel generally beneficial but negative effects in sulfur environment.  
Copper in a Cu-base Ni-containing alloy heals the protective oxide scale.


Operating Envelop:  
Additions of sulfur is used in cracking during ethylene production to prevent metal dusting. Sulfur slows the nucleation of graphite and stabilizes metastable carbides.  
Ethylene presence had been found to increase carbon formation rate.  
Increasing exposure temperature causes more oxide formation which reduces carbon deposition.
